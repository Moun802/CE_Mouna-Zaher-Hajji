# Hardware Components for MAX30102 Heartbeat Sensor Project

## 1. MAX30102 Sensor 
- **Description:** Measures heart rate and oxygen saturation using infrared and red LEDs. Communicates via I2C and works at 1.8Vâ€“3.3V logic levels.

## 2. Logic Level Converter
- **Description:** Safely converts logic signals (electrical signals) between 5V Arduino) and 3.3V (MAX30102) to prevent damage. *See the last section for more detail*

## 3. Microcontroller (Arduino Uno)
- **Description:** Runs the code that controls the sensor, reads data via I2C, and processes or sends it to the computer.

## 6. Breadboard and Jumper Wires
- **Description:** Used for building the circuit.

## 7. Computer
- **Description:** Used to write, upload, and monitor code via the Arduino IDE. 

## Additional components for data storage
### 9. MicroSD Card Module
- **Description:** Enables local storage of data to a microSD card.

### 10. microSD Card 
- **Description:** Removable memory card where the heart rate data is logged.
