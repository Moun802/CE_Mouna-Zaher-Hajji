# Arduino Project: Heart-Rate Monitor

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build an object capable of measuring the heart rate by simple contact with a sensor, in order to give a health profile to the user. Beyond this interactive facet of the project, it also aims to collect heart rate data and analyse it in a similar way to current pre-existing medical tools such as the EKG machine. This will be done with the Max30102 sensor, whose description can be found in the HARDWARE.md file.

## Wiring Instructions

| Arduino Pin | Logic Converter | MAX30102    |Description|
|-------------|--------------   |-------------|-----------|
| 3.3V        | LV              | VIN         |Powers MAX30102 via the low-voltage side (3.3V)|
| 5V          | HV              | ---         |Supplies 5V to high-voltage side of converter. Allows converter to accept the 5V from Arduino|
| GND         | GND(both sides) | GND         |Common ground connection. Reference point, all the devices must share ground|
| A4          | HV1             | ---         |Links Arduino's $I^2C$ data line to converter. Transmits data from sensor Arduino to sensor |
| A5          | HV2             | ---         |Links Arduino's $I^2C$ clock line to converter. Synchronizes the timing of data transfer between Arduino and sensor|
| 2           | ---             | INT         |Optional interrup signal. Alerts Arduino when a new sample of data is ready|
| ---         | LV2             | SCL         |Links converter's $I^2C$ data line to sensor. MAX30102 receives data requests via this line |
| ---         | LV1             | SDA         |Links converter's $I^2C$ clock line to sensor. Guides the sensor in the timing of data transfer|
