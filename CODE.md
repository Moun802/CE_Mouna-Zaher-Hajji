# Arduino Project: Heart-Rate Monitor

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build an object capable of measuring the heart rate by simple contact with a sensor, in order to give a health profile to the user. Beyond this interactive facet of the project, it also aims to collect heart rate data and analyse it in a similar way to current pre-existing medical tools such as the EKG machine. This will be done with the Max30102 sensor, whose description can be found in the HARDWARE.md file.
